At some point in the next wee while I will start to fill up this bit of the internet with content that I would want to read. All the things theyâ€™ve given me Aha! moments will fill up these pages.

But until that point it will be only this lonely little stub of content.

This little hello world with its title written in Scots.

Awright the boys used to say to me in the morning and it took me forever to realise that it meant hello!

If only there had been documentation about how to be a wee lad in Scotland in the 1980s!

But that's enough nostalgia. It's time to look forward to life made of js, api's and markup!

Thanks for stopping by!

Bis bald,

Ryan
