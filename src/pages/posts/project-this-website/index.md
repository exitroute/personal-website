**ryanoshea.dev presents me as a developer to the web development community
and marketplace.**

I choose Gatsby after listening to Kyle Matthews on podcasts and hearing
people speak positively about the developer experience.

The Gatsby documentation describes developing with Gatsby in simple terms, and
my first experience produced expected results quickly.

After getting into the weeds of SSG and SSR in the [resume site](https://github.com/exitroute/resume)
I wanted to try both css modules and styled-components as ways to organise
css, therefore both are still in the project.

This site and the one before was also my first try with CSS Grid.
