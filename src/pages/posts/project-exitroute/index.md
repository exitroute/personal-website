**Used a website builder [Carrd](https://www.carrd.co) to create and launch website for personal projects.**

The (lostintraslation.de)[https://www.ryanoshea.dev/projects/lostintranslation] made me realise that building websites wasn't as painful as I had imagined.

I wanted a simple website for my own projects. I had tried out SquareSpace, Wix and Wordpress but the amount of features was making it difficult for me to make design choices.

Carrd seemed the right platform to get started on something much more simple.
