      <h2>About RüDev</h2>
      <p>
        RüDev is a web development company that helps people and businesses get
        the most from contemporary web development and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rüdev was started by Ryan James O'Shea after pivoting his career, and
        then studying web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just beofre he started the final project of his course, he realised that
        any app he built would be most likely kinda useless. A typical learner
        project. Better to use the time to start building an organisation, 
        a company, a place to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rüdev works with small businesses, the self-employed, or anyone who
        wants to get more from the internet and web development. We love to
        explore and find what the problem and opportunity is, and then make what
        is needed and what is useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you have a website and it's no longer meeting you needs, or maybe
        you need a website but you are overwhelmed by the options. Rüdev will
        help you decide on the best solution and deliver something custom made
        that will
      </p>
      <p>Your experience with Rüdev is why Rüdev exists.</p>
      <p>
        We love doing this. We want you to enjoy the experience as much as we
        do!
