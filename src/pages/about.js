      <h2>About RüDev</h2>
      <p>
        RüDev is a web development company that helps people and businesses get
        the most from contemporary web development and design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rüdev was started by Ryan James O'Shea after forking his career, and
        then studying web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just before he started the final project of his course, he realised that
        any app he sbuilt would be most likely kinda useless. A typical learner
        project. Better to use the time to start building an organisation, a
        company, a place to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rüdev works with small businesses, the self-employed, or anyone who
        wants to get more from the internet and web development. We love to
        explore and find what the problem and opportunity is, and then make what
        is needed and what is useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe you have a website and it's no longer meeting you needs, or maybe
        you need a website but you are overwhelmed by the options. Rüdev will
        help you decide on the best solution and deliver something custom made
        that will
      </p>
      <p>Your experience with Rüdev is why Rüdev exists.</p>
      <p>
        We love doing this. We want you to enjoy the experience as much as we
        do!

      <h2>About Ryan</h2>
      <p>
        Ryan James O'Shea is a web developer living and working in Silicon
        Allee, Berlin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software development is a irresistable way for him to combine and use
        his experience as a manager, a designer, and trainer with 10,000 hours
        in the classroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that experience as a trainer and manager, he got to know the
        importance of learning and performance. He wants to learn about his
        clients needs, reason about those needs, and then to perform as
        developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before web development, Ryan had a 12 year career in edtech with Wall
        Street English and Pearson Education, and has a training in
        architectural design from the University of Strathcylde in Glasgow.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he's running a workshop and needs a warm up where the introduction
        needs a fun fact about him, he usual says something about: Sandor
        Clegane, Pete Doherty or Sven Martinek.
