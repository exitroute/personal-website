# Personal Website

This site was built using Gatsby, React, Styled Components, 
CSS Modules, and uses CSS Gird for layout, and is deployed using Netlify.

I choose Gatsby after listening to Kyle Matthews on podcasts and hearing 
people speak positively about the developer experience.

The Gatsby documentation describes developing with Gatsby in simple terms, and 
my first experience produced expected results quickly.

After getting into the weeds of SSG and SSR in the [resume site](https://github.com/exitroute/resume) 
I wanted to try both css modules and styled-components as ways to organise 
css, therefore both are still in the project.

This site and the one before was also my first try with CSS Grid.

## Learning Points

- more practice thinking in terms of Atomic design is needed
- I really like this stack
- the obstacle is the way

## Status

Deployed and active. Enhancements planned as priority.
